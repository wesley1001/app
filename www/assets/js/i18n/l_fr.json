			"paragraphFour": "In addition to that, you can add other data to your profile, including your date of birth, the city you live in and your relationship status.  Each information is encrypted and will initially only be visible to you. You can then define the rights for each and every piece of information, defining exactly who can see what. You want your friends to see your date of birth, but not where you currently live? No problem. Everyone belonging to your circle 'Colleagues' should see where you work, but not your relationship status? Easy. Just enter your settings and add individual friends, or whole groups for each part.
